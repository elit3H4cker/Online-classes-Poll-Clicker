# Online-classes-Poll-Clicker
This python script can help you in clicking the poll that were created during online classes.
The only thing you have to do is to take the screenshot of the poll and edit the script and replace the search.png name with the name of the screenshot you have taken
#Dont do anything on the screen when the script is running as it work on the present screen and if any program is opened at the time of running, script cant recongise the poll and so it will not able to click that.
